# pts1-prediction-tool
This project offers a classification-algorithm for predicting the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (pts1) in a given amino acid sequence (primary structur of a protein)

The aminosequences for the learning sets are downloaded from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/), 23.07.2020.

Run test with: \
```pipenv shell  ``` \
```python -m unittest tests/pts1_prediction_tests.py ```
